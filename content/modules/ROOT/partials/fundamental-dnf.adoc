== Overview

Software packages in RHEL 10 are managed with a tool called *dnf*.

Introduced in 2013, *dnf* was a significant improvement to it's predecessor *yum*.  Landing in RHEL 8, *dnf* replaced *yum* while still maintaining a great deal of compatibility.

When compared to YUM, DNF offers:

    * better functionality
    * better performace and scalability
    * better dependency resolution
    * consistent (strict) API adherence
    * compatibility with YUM

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node1` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node1`.

[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh node1
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-dnf-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Core Concepts

Software in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is bundled into something called an 'rpm'.  At a highlevel an 'rpm' file includes both 

    * the files (payload) of a specific installation 
    * as well as metadata about what's getting installed

The metadata includes (but is not limited to):

    * common name
    * version
    * where and when it was built
    * digital/security signatures
    * checksums

Next, rpm packages get organized into structures called repositories (or repos for short) which are then published 
as sources to distribute content.   More on this topic in the Intermediate Package Management unit.

Working with rpms directly can be challenging.  Luckily tooks like *dnf* exist to abstract that complexity
and replace it with simple intuitive commands and processes.

Let's get started!


== List packages

Simple command to list all available packages.  This includes all configured and available repos.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf list
----

Command to list only the installed packages.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf list --installed
----

Command to list available packages.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf list --available
----

A quick comparison of how many packages are installed vs available.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf list --installed | wc -l
dnf list --available | wc -l
----

You should a result roughly '622' packages installed compared to '4760' available for installation.

Last, let us identify packages that are installed but do not belong to any known repository.  Meaning, someone downloaded and installed it manually.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf list --extras
----



== Package Details

Command to list a specific package.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf list bash-completion
----

Let us get some detailed information about this package.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf info bash-completion
----

[{format_output}]
----
Available Packages
Name         : bash-completion
Epoch        : 1
Version      : 2.11

Description  : bash-completion is a collection of shell functions that take advantage
             : of the programmable completion feature of bash.
----



== Install Packages

Installing a package is simple.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf install -y bash-completion
----

Installing multiple packages from a simgle command is also easy.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf install -y  httpd mariadb mariadb-server php
----

Some of the pacakges listed above where likely already installed on the host, thus the ouput may have been very underwhelming.
This set of packages is collectively known as the traditional LAMP stack:  Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.

NOTE: the MySQL project got forked long ago and it's successor is MariaDB



== Remove Packages

To remove a package from the system you can run *dnf* as follows.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf remove -y php
----



== Update Packages

To update packages on a host you use the 'update' operand.  For the purposes of this lab, we don't want to use up your time performing an actaul upgrade.  However, there is something to be learned by performing a dry-run (or a harmless test).


[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf update -y --setopt tsflags=test
----

NOTE: If the system is fully patched then the output will yeild no results.  The output shown here is for example only and probably won't match what you see.

[{format_output}]
----
<...snip...>
(54/56): python3-perf-6.12.0-55.7.1.el10_0.x86_64.rpm                       12 MB/s | 1.8 MB     00:00    
(55/56): yggdrasil-0.4.5-2.el10_0.x86_64.rpm                                32 MB/s | 5.6 MB     00:00

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                                                                       64 MB/s | 320 MB     00:04     
Running transaction check
Transaction check succeeded.
Running transaction test
Transaction test succeeded.
Complete!
The downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.
You can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.
----

From this output, we can determine that 56 packages were evaluated for the upgrade and that all the transaction tests completed.  
As part of the test, the software was also downloaded and staged in the cache directories in /var/lib. Thus when the time comes
to actaully install the updates, you can save that initial download time by running a test like this in advance.



== Security Update Only

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf update --security
----

[{format_output}]
----
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
Last metadata expiration check: 0:36:21 ago on Mon 07 Apr 2025 04:34:43 PM UTC.
No security updates needed, but 56 updates available
Dependencies resolved.
Nothing to do.
Complete!
----

RHEL 10 is still very early in it's life (we may still be using the BETA for this lab).  Here we see that there are no security updates currently available for our release.



== Clean ALL

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf clean all
----



== What About Reboots?

*dnf* is not tasked with understanding what packages may require a reboot in order to complete an installation or upgrade.

To answer "when?" really requires a deep understanding of how Lunix works.  The "safe" answer is always, but that certainly is not practical nor a reality.

Advanced technologies like 'kpatch' were developed in order to improve the security response without ALWAYS requiring a reboot. 
Even then, with kpatch one cannot SKIP a reboot, one can only DELAY the reboot.  More about that in the advanced kpatch unit.


== Conclusion

This concludes the first exercises related to `dnf`.

Time to finish this unit and return the shell to it's home position.
