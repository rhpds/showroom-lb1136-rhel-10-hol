== *Skill Level: Fundamental* icon:check[]




== Overview

Systemd is the "init" system for RHEL 10 (ever since RHEL 7 for that matter).  Long ago it replaced Upstart, the SysV "init" system used in releases of RHEL 6.x and older.  Systemd is more than just a facility to bring up user space, it is a system manager that offers:

  * service parallelization
  * socket and D-Bus activation
  * on-demand starting of services
  * track services and child processes via cgroups
  * and much more

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node1` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node1`.

[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh node1
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-systemd-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Core Concepts

=== Units

The fundamental building block that systemd manages is called a "unit".  A "unit" can describe different types of objects, but the most common type is a "service".  

A "unit file" is the configuration file that describes a unit and tells systemd what dependencies exist and how to start, stop and monitor the object.

"unit files" are stored in 2 different directories.  One location is reserved for the default configurations as shipped by Red Hat and the other is for customization by the local administrators.

  * Red Hat unit files:    /usr/lib/systemd/system/...
  * Customizations:        /etc/systemd/system/...

=== Targets
systemd has a concept similar to SysV init runlevels, called targets.  systemd will boot to the “default target” which can be configured using the systemctl set-default command.  Some common targets and their equivalent SysV runlevels are:

  * multi-user.target == runlevel 3
  * graphical.target == runlevel 5

Let's view the current default target.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl get-default
----

[{format_output}]
----
multi-user.target
----

=== Services
As mentioned above, systemd has another concept called a service.  A service is a type of unit which defines the traditional daemon or process.  Now let us look at what services are running on the system:

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl -t service | head -n 15
----

[{format_output}]

UNIT                               LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
  UNIT                                                  LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
  auditd.service                                        loaded active running Security Audit Logging Service

  cloud-init.service                                    loaded failed failed  Cloud-init: Network Stage

  dbus-broker.service                                   loaded active running D-Bus System Message Bus
  dracut-shutdown.service                               loaded active exited  Restore /run/initramfs on shutdown
  firewalld.service                                     loaded active running firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
  fwupd.service                                         loaded active running Firmware update daemon

  irqbalance.service                                    loaded active running irqbalance daemon
----

Next let's view all of the services available (ie: everything installed, running or not) on the system. The following command is similar to the older chkconfig --list as it will show both enabled and disabled services:

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl --no-pager list-unit-files -t service
----

[{format_output}]
----
UNIT FILE                                             STATE           PRESET  
audit-rules.service                                   enabled         enabled 
auditd.service                                        enabled         enabled 
auth-rpcgss-module.service                            static          -       
autovt@.service                                       alias           -

cloud-config.service                                  enabled         enabled 
cloud-final.service                                   enabled         enabled 
cloud-init-hotplugd.service                           static          -       
cloud-init-local.service                              enabled         enabled 
cloud-init.service                                    enabled         enabled 

...<output truncated>...
----

The state will  be enabled, disabled, static, or masked.  Static indicates that the unit file does not contain an "install" section used to enable the unit.  In this case, the unit typically performs a one-off action or is used as a dependency of another unit and should not be run by itself.



== Analyzing System Startup

Let's collect some initial data about the boot process

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemd-analyze
----

[{format_output}]
----
Startup finished in 1.582s (kernel) + 2.850s (initrd) + 46.531s (userspace) = 50.963s 
multi-user.target reached after 41.873s in userspace.
----

Next let's inspect further details about all running units, ordered by the time they took to initialize.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemd-analyze blame | head -n 15
----

[{format_output}]
----
10.613s kdump.service
 3.876s dev-ttyS1.device
 3.876s sys-devices-platform-serial8250-serial8250:0-serial8250:0.1-tty-ttyS1.device
 3.871s dev-ttyS2.device
 3.871s sys-devices-platform-serial8250-serial8250:0-serial8250:0.2-tty-ttyS2.device
 3.843s sys-devices-pnp0-00:00-00:00:0-00:00:0.0-tty-ttyS0.device
 3.843s dev-ttyS0.device
 3.840s dev-ttyS3.device
 3.840s sys-devices-platform-serial8250-serial8250:0-serial8250:0.3-tty-ttyS3.device
 3.839s sys-module-configfs.device
 3.758s dev-virtio\x2dports-org.qemu.guest_agent.0.device
 3.758s sys-devices-pci0000:00-0000:00:02.4-0000:05:00.0-virtio1-virtio\x2dports-vport1p1.device
 3.758s dev-vport1p1.device
 3.708s sys-devices-pci0000:00-0000:00:04.2-0000:0b:00.0-virtio7-block-vdf.device
 3.708s dev-disk-by\x2ddiskseq-6.device
----

This helps to learn the “cost” of some of the default services.  To speed up boot-time, unnecessary services could potentially be removed or disabled.


== Enable a LAMP Stack

=== Install Packages

Now that we have a good idea of what’s installed on our system, let’s get a basic lamp stack up and running.

NOTE: You may have already installed all (or a portion) of these packages in previous exercises, but we'll just do it again for completeness 

Let us install some packages.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf install -y httpd mariadb-server mariadb php
----

[{format_output}]
----
...<output truncated>...

Package httpd-2.4.63-1.el10.x86_64 is already installed.
Package mariadb-server-3:10.11.11-1.el10.x86_64 is already installed.
Package mariadb-3:10.11.11-1.el10.x86_64 is already installed.
Package php-8.3.15-1.el10.x86_64 is already installed.
Dependencies resolved.
Nothing to do.
Complete!
----

=== Enable Services

Now it's time to enable the relevant system services.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl enable --now httpd mariadb
----

[{format_output}]
----
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mariadb.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service.
----

Now let's check the status.  You should see two separate sections in the output, one for httpd and one for mariadb.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl --no-pager status httpd mariadb
----

[{format_output}]
----

=== Enable Firewall

Last but not least, you need to enable a firewall port.  If you are progressing through these exercises sequentially, you may not be familiar the with the firewall system in RHEL just yet.  We will withhold further discussion on the topic until then.  For now, just run the following command to make the service accessible.

[{format_cmd}]
----
firewall-cmd --add-service=http
----

[{format_output}]
----
success
----

And that's it.  The needed serivces are running and network ports are accessible.

== Conclusion

This concludes the first exercises related to `systemd`.

Time to finish this unit and return the shell to it's home position.
