= *In-Place Upgrades* (leapp)

[discrete]
== *Skill Level: Advanced*



== Overview

WARNING:  This exercise requires the SECONDARY terminal and conflicts with any other exercise (ex: ebpf) that 
uses the secondary terminal.  Do not proceed if the secondary terminal is already in use with another exercise.

In this unit we introduce LEAPP,  an in-place OS upgrade tool used to:

  * analyze a host,
  * report on potential issues,
  * provide remediation assistance,
  * and finally execute the upgrade procedure.


Because the upgrade is a lengthy process, this exercise uses the secondary terminal. The intent is to dedicate the secondary terminal to the leapp upgrade, thereby leaving the primary terminal available for other exercises while the upgrade executes.


The first several sections leading up to the actual upgrade are interactive and should take around 7 - 8 minutes to complete.  The sections which perform the actual upgrade and finalize it are almost completely non-interactive and each are expected to take 6 - 9 minutes to complete.  Once you start them, you will have time to look at other exercises in the PRIMARY terminal while waiting for them to complete.

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `leapp` as user `root`.  Before you begin, confirm the node was provisioned with RHEL 9.6

Launch a 'tmux' (terminal multiplexer) in the second showroom terminal:

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-tmux.sh TERM2
----

Using the second terminal for all steps below, proceed to ssh from host `bastion` to `leapp`.

[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh leapp
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-leapp-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Current RHEL Version Verification

Verify through a few commands that this is currently running RHEL 9.  These will show the current version of RHEL, the version of the running kernel and the rpm repos available to the system.

[{format_cmd}]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

[{format_output}]
----
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 9.6 (Plow)
----

[{format_cmd}]
----
uname -r
----

[{format_output}]
----
5.14.0-570.13.1.el9_6.x86_64
----
(note: your output may differ)

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf repolist
----

[{format_output}]
----

rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                          Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-supplementary-rpms                   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - Supplementary (RPMs)
----

You are now ready to proceed with the exercises.

=======
NOTE: When performing an in-place upgrade in your own lab or production environments, you will need to disable any non-Red Hat repositories prior to starting the in-place upgrade process.  Application upgrade(s) will need to take place after the operating system upgrade has completed.  A command similar to the following could be used:

[{format_output}]
----
dnf config-manager --set-disabled <my-custom-application-repo-name>
----
=======

== Installation

=== Tools
Install the LEAPP tools and any dependencies (this may already be done)

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf install -y leapp-upgrade
----

=== Cleanup

Delete any results from any possible previous attempts to run leapp

[{format_cmd}]
----
rm -rf /var/log/leapp /root/tmp_leapp_py3
----

===  Update Host

Ensure all RHEL 9 Packages are up to date.

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf -y update
----

=== Reboot

To ensure that all updates have taken effect and that we are running on the latest kernel,
check the hostname is correct and reboot.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ $(hostname -s) == "leapp" ]] && reboot
----

Using the second terminal reconnect to the `leapp` node once it has rebooted (should be 15 - 20 seconds).

[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh leapp
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----


== Pre-Upgrade

=== Scan

Now run the preupgrade option to generate a preliminary report to see if there are any issues found that could prevent the upgrade from proceeding smoothly.

[{format_cmd}]
----
leapp preupgrade
----

=== Report

The output from the previous command should have listed a few items that are inhibiting the upgrade of the host.

[{format_output}]

============================================================
                      REPORT OVERVIEW                       
============================================================

Upgrade has been inhibited due to the following problems:
    1. Not enough space on /boot

HIGH and MEDIUM severity reports:
    1. GRUB2 core will be automatically updated during the upgrade

(... output omitted ...)

Before continuing, review the full report below for details about discovered problems and possible remediation instructions:
    A report has been generated at /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
    A report has been generated at /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.json

Notice that the output refers you to the pre-upgrade report for details and remediations.  If your system has the cockpit-leapp package installed, you can switch to using a web-broswer to step through each item and inspect the remediation options.  A sample image is provided at the end of this exercise as a reference.

Look at the first several lines of the report mentioned above, /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt

[{format_cmd}]
----
head /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
----

The first two lines indicate a Risk Factor, in this case high/inhibitor meaning that this issue will prevent the upgrade from proceeding entirely.

[{format_output}]
----
Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Not enough space on /boot
Summary: /boot needs additional 24.09765625 MiB to be able to accommodate the upgrade initramfs and new kernel.
Related links:
    - Why does kernel cannot be upgraded due to insufficient space in /boot ?: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/298263
----

This tells us that there is not enough space in the /boot directory to proceed.  Let's take a look:

[{format_cmd}]
----
ls -l /boot
----

[{format_output}]
----
total 859436

drwx------. 4 root root        65 Jun 10 13:32 grub2
  (output truncated...)
----

Sure enough, there is a very big file, coincidentally called "bigfile" that is over 600MB.  It was placed there to show what an "Inhibitor" would look like as part of the preupgrade process, so we know that it is safe to remove.  The Leapp documentation (link at the end of the exercise) goes into more examples of things that could be inhibitors like device drivers that may not be supported.  It also outlines environments that are not supported for an in-place upgrade such as Network based multipath and network storage that use Ethernet or Infiniband. This includes booting from SAN using FC. Note that SAN using FC are supported, just not booting from SAN.


== Remediate

With that in mind, let's fix the blocker/inhibitor and make sure there's enough space in /boot

[{format_cmd}]
----
rm -f /boot/bigfile
df -h /boot
----

[{format_output}]
----
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda3       960M  318M  643M  34% /boot
----

Much better.  Now re-run the preupgrade. This time there should be no inhibitors, and it will now take a couple minutes longer:

[{format_cmd}]
----
leapp preupgrade
----

The output should now come back clean without any inhibitors that would prevent a successful upgrade.

== Upgrade

Feel free to inspect the /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt file.  Everything should be ready to run the upgrade.  This will install several rpms, make some repo and other configuration changes, and will take several minutes (6 to 10 in our vm testing).  

[{format_cmd}]
----
time leapp upgrade
----

After several minutes (probably 7 - 9) you should see an almost identical report output indicating that phase one of the upgrade has completed

Reboot the system to continue with the upgrade. This might take a while depending on the system configuration.
Make sure you have console access to view the actual upgrade process.

== Finalize the Upgrade

To finish the upgrade process, a reboot is now required.  Without console access you won't be able to see the final 
and unfortunately this is the step that takes the longest. 

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ $(hostname -s) == "leapp" ]] && reboot
----

[{format_output}]
----
Connection to leapp closed by remote host.
Connection to leapp closed.
----

After another 6 - 9 minutes, you should be able to ssh back in from the bastion host

Here is a command you can run on the bastion to loop until the leapp host is
back online

[{format_cmd}]
----
time until $( nc -z leapp 22 ) ; do echo -n "." ; sleep 3 ; done
----

WARNING: Do not proceed until the leapp upgrade process is complete



[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh leapp
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

== Final RHEL Version Verification

Finally, re-run the commands from earlier to verify that the leapp node has actually been upgraded to RHEL9

[{format_cmd}]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

[{format_output}]
----
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 10.0 (Coughlan)
----

[{format_cmd}]
----
uname -r
----

[{format_output}]
----
6.12.0-55.16.1.el10_0.x86_64
----

[{format_cmd}]
----
dnf repolist
----

[{format_output}]
----
Updating Subscription Management repositories.

This system has release set to 10.0 and it receives updates only for this release.  

repo id                               repo name
rhel-10-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms     Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-10-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms        Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
rhel-10-for-x86_64-supplementary-rpms Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 for x86_64 - Supplementary (RPMs)
----

NOTE: The Leapp process has explicitly set the release version to "10.0".  This means that updates will only be available and applied for the RHEL 10.0 version.  This can be modified to a more general version "10" in order to receive ongoing updates as more point releases of RHEL 10 come out using either of the following:

[{format_output}]
----
subscription-manager release --set 10
subscription-manager release --unset

== A Word About Web Console Integration

This exercise has illustrated a very simple example of upgrading a RHEL8 system in place to a RHEL9 system, with a single issue that was easy to remediate and no applications running on top of the OS.  In the real world, there are likely to be more issues that need to be addressed and in some cases there are known issues that will prevent an in place upgrade (see official Red Hat documentation link below).  There is a Web Console plugin that makes it easier to visualize and in many cases remediate upgrade inhibitors that arise.  The rpm is called "cockpit-leapp" and once installed will enable visualization like this

====

== Conclusion

Whether upgrading in place is right is a decision that needs to be made from one environment to the next, one group to the next, even from one system to the next.  What makes sense for one application might not make sense for another.  As with any OS upgrade, test in the lab and do backups!

Time to finish this unit and return the shell to it's home position.
