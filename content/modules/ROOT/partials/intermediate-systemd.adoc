= *Service Management* (systemd)

[discrete]
== *Skill Level: Intermediate* icon:check[]




== Overview

You have already been introduced to systemd and the fundamentals of service management. Now we’ll progress to the more sophisticated 
capabilities of systemd and customization of the services with additional functionality.

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node1` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node1`.

[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh node1
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-systemd-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.


== Customize Default Services

systemd controls more than just daemons or services. For this lab, we will primarily be working with service units but it's important to 
know that systemd is handling the dependencies between other types of units: 

  * sockets
  * timers 
  * mounts 
  * swap
  * slices
  * more...

Unit files are stored in one of three places:

  * '/usr/lib/systemd/system' - default configs that ship with the RHEL and are updated by regular maintenance
  * '/etc/systemd/system' - custom configs that persist and replace (or augment) default configs
  * '/run/systemd/system' - runtime changes that won't persist

While the defaults for unit files won’t need to be altered most of the time, there will be circumstances where changing the defaults is quite beneficial. These could include hardware or software watchdog monitoring, tunings, resource management, or many other reasons.


=== Modify httpd

Create a drop-in configuration file to extend the default httpd.service unit

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-systemd-httpdconfig.sh
----

[{format_output}]
Contents of /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/50-httpd.conf
----
[Service]
Restart=always
OOMScoreAdjust=-1000
----

OOMScoreAdjust is used by the Kernel's Out Of Memory killer and is an  integer between -1000 (to disable OOM killing for this process) and 1000 (to make killing of this process under memory pressure very likely).  

Notify systemd of the changes.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl daemon-reload
----

=== Modify mariadb

Similar to what you did in the last step, extend the mariadb.service unit with Restart=always. 

This time we'll use systemctl to create the drop-in and notify systemd of the changes.

`systemctl edit` allows inserting the content for the drop-in and also handles the `systemctl daemon-reload` automatically.


WARNING: You must add your service customizations BETWEEN the commented lines near the top of the template, otherwise your update will be discarded


Your edit should look like this before you save it.

[{format_plain}]
----
### Editing /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/override.conf
### Anything between here and the comment below will become the new contents of the file

[Service]
Restart=always

### Lines below this comment will be discarded
----

Proceed to make your changes now.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl edit mariadb
----

Type (cut & paste) the following using the automatically launched editor (vi) between the commented lines as outlined above:

[{format_cmd}]
----
[Service]
Restart=always
----

Save and quit the editor (type :wq , then press <ENTER>) then view the unit

`systemctl cat` is a quick and easy way to view the contents of a unit and its drop-ins.

[{format_cmd}]
----
systemctl --no-pager cat mariadb
----

[{format_output}]
----
...snip...
# Restart crashed server only, on-failure would also restart, for example, when
# my.cnf contains unknown option
Restart=on-abort
RestartSec=5s

UMask=007

# Give a reasonable amount of time for the server to start up/shut down
TimeoutSec=300

# Place temp files in a secure directory, not /tmp
PrivateTmp=true

# /etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/override.conf

Notice that systemctl status displays that the unit has been extended with a drop-in file.

== Conclusion

Hopefully you should now have a fundamental understanding of how services 
are installed, managed and customized on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.

Time to finish this unit and return the shell to its home position.
